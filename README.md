# Etch-a-Sketch WebGrid

Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch WebGrid project! This interactive webpage allows you to draw pixelated masterpieces on a YxY where Y>0 and Y<100 grid of square divs. Let's get started!

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Etch-a-Sketch-WebGrid.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your Browser:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **Draw on the Grid:**
   Hover over the grid squares and start drawing like you would on an Etch-a-Sketch!


## Customize Grid Size
  There's a button at the top that prompts you for the number of squares per side for a new grid.
  Set a maximum limit of 100 squares to prevent potential performance issues.
  Upon entering the desired number, the existing grid is replaced with a new one while maintaining the same total space.

## How to Use

1. **Draw on the Grid:**
   Hover over the squares to draw.
   
2. **Customize Grid Size:**
   Click the button at the top, enter the desired size, and enjoy a new sketch pad.
